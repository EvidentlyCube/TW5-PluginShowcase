# Permaviews [TiddlyWiki5 Plugin]

Define lists of tiddlers that automatically open when you visit a predefined permalink.

## How to use:

Go to Control Panel -> Evidently Cube -> Permaviews and define as many views as you would like:

 * Give it a name by which it can be accessed.
 * Optionally describe it for bookkeeping.
 * Write a filter or a list of tiddler you want to be opened when you visit the permalink

Then use the permalink to change the story river to be those tiddlers only,
