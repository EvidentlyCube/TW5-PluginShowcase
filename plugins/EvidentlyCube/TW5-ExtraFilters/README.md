# Extra Operators [TiddlyWiki5 Plugin]

A collection of awesome filter operators to TW5. Currently available are:

* `focus-on` -- Find specific text and its context and remove everything else.
* `susearch` -- Intelligently search through tiddler fields optionally including or ignoring the wikitext.
* `susearch-mark` -- Create a preview of the search results with highlighted matches. Ignore wikitext, strip wikitext or parse wikitext and decide whether to display it as text or HTML.
* `susearch-sort` -- Intelligently sort search results by how relevant they are to a search query.
