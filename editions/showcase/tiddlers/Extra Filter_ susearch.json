Structure\n\n```\nsusearch[query]\n\nsusearch:field:flags[query]\n```\n\n* ''Input:'' A selection of titles.\n* ''Suffixes:''\n** `:field` -- //(optional)// Field through which to search. ''Defaults to `title`''\n** `:flags` -- //(optional)// Set to `raw-strip` to strip all WikiText and HTML before searching. Most useful when searching through the contents of tiddlers.\n* ''Operands:''\n** `[query]` -- The text to search for. It will match:\n*** The whole phrase\n*** Every word in the phrase as-is\n*** Every word in the phrase with stripped special characters, while also stripping the same special characters from the searched text.\n* ''Output:'' Input titles that passed the search query, unchanged, in the same order as they were provided.\n\n!! Edge cases:\n\n* If `[query]` operand is empty all input titles will be returned.\n* If `input` is empty `output` will also be empty.\n\n!
