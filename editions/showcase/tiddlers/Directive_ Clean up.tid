This is one of the rules I follow while developing plugins. Its consequences are:

* Any tiddlers that the plugin creates can be easily removed.
* Any tiddlers that are created as a relation to another plugin are removed if the parent plugin is removed.
* If a plugin has relations to other tiddlers, those relations are updated when relevant tiddlers are renamed.
